This is a system we made using SQL and Java along with out knowledge of foreign and relational keys in databases. It should be bale to store books, checkouts, members and overdue books along with everything having a relation(for example, you can't delete a book if its already checked by someone). FrontEnd is mostly javaswing while the backend relies on a SQL server and DB already premade. Two members tested it with a SQL extension on VScode while remaining three tested it on a AWS server. 

Make sure the MySQL connector jar is in the referenced libraries of the java project, or it will not work. You wil get an error saying "drive not found" or whatever.
